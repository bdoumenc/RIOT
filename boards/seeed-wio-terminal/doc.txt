@brief       Support for the Seeed WIO Terminal board.

## Overview

Compatible with Arduino and MicroPython, Wio Terminal is an ATSAMD51-based
microcontroller with wireless connectivity supported by Realtek RTL8720DN.
Its CPU speed runs at 120MHz (Boost up to 200MHz). Realtek RTL8720DN chip
supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi providing the backbone for IoT projects.
The Wio Terminal itself is equipped with a 2.4‚Äù LCD Screen, onboard 
IMU(LIS3DHTR), Microphone, Buzzer, microSD card slot, Light sensor,
and Infrared Emitter(IR 940nm).

The [UF2 Bootloader](https://github.com/microsoft/uf2-samdx1) is
used to program this board. The ATSAMD51P19A is a ARM Cortex-M4 micro-controller.
It has 4MiB of flash memory and 192KiB of RAM.

## Flashing the device

Assuming the [UF2 Bootloader](https://github.com/microsoft/uf2-samdx1) is
installed, just run:

```
make BOARD=seeed-wio-terminal flash
```

Hint: You can you press the reset button twice to manually enter the bootloader.
This is helpful if the board has crashed (e.g. due to a failed assert() during
start up).
